# Multi-Agent Systems
I did a project on the subject of Multi-Agent Systems with github.com/toonn in Java (using the RinSim MAS simulator), but as we generally wrote it together on 1 computer for most of the time there's no telling which code is "my code" and which code is "his code". But you can check out https://github.com/toonn/mas-1314 for the result. It isn't fully up-to-date, we redid a lot of the text in the submission and a bunch of the experiments in the summer, but none of the code should have changed so in that respect it should be accurate enough.
Be warned, a lot of it was written late at night and there are some... rather interesting jokes in there :wink: We spent a rather unfashionable amount of time picking colors for the visualization (we settled on vermillion, periwinkle and malachite) and arguing about names for some of the methods (i.e. `ensconce`, `yoink`, `purge`, ...)

# StudentSave, an Android app
For a course on Interface Design I made an app together with 2 other students. I wrote a couple of the screens. I was the only one with an Android phone so I could test more rapidly, which was quite helpful.
The app is on the Play Store if you wish to try it.

# Others
I've written a great number of assignments in Java, but most of them I'd rather not show... The two I mentioned above are the only ones I contributed to during my Master's degree (that I could think of, there may be others) so I picked those.
