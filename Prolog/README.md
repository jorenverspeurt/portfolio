#herbst.pl
Something I attempted to write to parse and manipulate data that came out of a tiling window manager I was using at one point. It allowed dumping and loading certain window configurations and I was trying to make statistics to display in the top bar about the number of open windows, as well as making a way to color stacks of windows by certain attributes, creating an undo function, etc.
It makes use of SWI Prolog's PEG functionality.
I don't know if it actually works, I ended up switching to another window manager (which I could customize directly in Python).

#slitherlink eclipse sol.ecl
This technically isn't Prolog but ECLiPSe, a constraint-based language. It solves Slitherlink puzzles, using channeling.
It had more than the required functionality and it solved one of the harder problems in the assignment in a way that, in my humble opinion, is quite interesting. If you ask me I might be able to explain it to you (though it'll probably take me a while to remember).
It might not be the world's most interesting code and a lot of it is ugly because the elegant solution I tried didn't work well (ECLiPSe is very... sensitive) but I was quite pleased with my solution in the end and it was quite enjoyable to write, despite the tight deadline.
I also wrote a Sudoku solver but that wasn't even remotely interesting.
If you would like to try to run it I might put the puzzles and a couple of the helper scripts you'll need online. Or you could check out https://github.com/toonn/aplai
I'm not entirely sure of the licenses of all of the puzzles we used so proceed with caution.
