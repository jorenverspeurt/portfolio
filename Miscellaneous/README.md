This folder contains a couple of things I might consider showing off that are either not code-related or written in some esoteric language.

GraphTheoryAssignment contains my solution to a problem given to me in the Capita Selecta AI course on Graph Theory. 
The assignment was to think of improvements to a specific path finding algorithms in graphs. 
The algorithm takes a dynamic programming approach using a specially crafted algebra with interesting properties to represent the nodes in the graph. Repeating an operation on these elements can then reveal the amount of paths of the requested kind that can be found in the graph. This is, however, a stochastic algorithm, so the number of paths returned by the algorithm is only correct with certainty when performed an infinite number of times.
2 pages doesn't seem like much but understanding the algorithm enough to propose changes to it took me quite a while. It's a rather advanced algorithm and I hadn't even had any Graph Theory before starting this assignment, so when I figured out how and why it worked it was quite the eureka moment.

KolmogorovsPetSnake contains a puzzle I solved for fun that came from a Capture The Flag competition that a friend of mine participated in. Further explanation in the folder's README.
